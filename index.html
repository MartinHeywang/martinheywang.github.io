                        First of all, I got into programming because it is the first thing that I could
                        scratch my head on enough. I love to solve problems, even if they can be really
                        useless sometimes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__p">
                        At school, when I was 13, we used to do some Scratch programs and this how I got
                        into programming. Because I needed more, I started learning my first real
                        programming language : Java. One year later, I found myself presenting a simple
                        hangman game to the “party” of my school, I was already 15 years old.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story_p">
                        But still, I needed more. I started a project, "PRODUCTS.", a game -, and it
                        lasted for over a year and a half ! It was the first time I had the motivation to
                        keep a project for more that long.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story_p">
                        But this project got to an end as I got into web development - I needed to
                        breath, to do something else. This is where I am currently, and I’m not excluding
                        the fact that I may restart PRODUCTS; but probably under another nickname and
                        probably with other technologies (Web Assembly ???) .
                    </p>
                    <p class="story_p">.. and if you wonder, I still want MORE !!!</p>
